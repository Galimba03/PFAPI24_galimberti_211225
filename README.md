# PFAPI24 Galimberti 211225

This is the project I've done for the class of Algoritmi e Principi Informatici.

## Main Contents
The project includes implementations of:
- **Sorting algorithms** (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort)  
- **Data structures** (e.g., linked lists, hash tables, queues)  
- **Recursion and iteration examples**  
- **Basic file handling and memory management in C**  
- **Algorithm complexity analysis and performance considerations**

## Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to serve both as a learning resource and a reference for students or anyone interested in deepening their understanding of algorithms and structured programming in C.

## How to Run
To compile and run any file:

```bash
gcc main.c -o output
./output
```
Make sure you have a C compiler like gcc installed on your system.

##License
This project is open-source and free to use for educational purposes.
